# DigIt
Please note that DigIt was tested on Firefox 85 Default, mainly. Slightly broken on the Chromium engine and Trident. Site performs remarkably well on Internet Explorer, so that's another reason to use DigIt.

Please credit **kat and Digable** if you are publishing anywhere else, and ask **Digable#0505** *(Discord)* for permission to publish a modified version.
